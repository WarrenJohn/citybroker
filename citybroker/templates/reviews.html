                <p class="my-4"><i><span style="font-style: normal;">Warren makes the house hunt and entire buying process very convenient and painless. He is always available for a phone call, or a quick email to answer any questions i may have. He is very knowledgeable, organized and thorough. His online Authentisign program made signing offers back an forth a breeze as I am from out of town, being able to sign an offer right from my phone was much easier then putting pen to paper. Thanks for your help Warren!!</span></i></p>

                <p class="my-4"><i><span style="font-style: normal;"><i><span style="font-style: normal;"><br>I had the pleasure of working with Warren this year and was very pleased with his diligence and the persistent effort he made in searching out a rental property that met my expectations. Warren worked for a period of 8 months to find the properties that finally closed this past August. I have worked with other agents over the past 3 years and none were as committed to their work.&nbsp;<br>Warren takes the time to understand his clientâ€™s needs and to help identify possible problems that may exist with the viewed properties. This demonstrates his commitment to first and foremost, meet the needs of his clients. I look forward to working with Warren in the future and would recommend Warren and his the services to anyone looking to purchase property.
Thanks Warren!

I just recently worked with Warren John. He helped me lease 209 Wellington St. London, ON. Professionally, I had a great experience with him and we've remained friends to this day. He helped us get the price &amp; term I was looking for with some other bonus features that were nice. I would highly recommend working with Warren if you are in London Ontario or the surrounding area!

                <p class="my-4"><i><span style="font-style: normal;"><br>Warren was an awesome real estate agent! As we are first time home buyers, and moving from Manitoba, Warren made an easy adjustment for us, and represented us well during the process. With his dedication we were able to view, settle an offer, and do an inspection all in one weekend which was a major save for us as we were only in London for two days. Thank you Warren for your dedication and willingness to work with us Manitobans!</span></i></p>

He was patient and professional at all times. We thoroughly enjoyed working with him and we would recommend him to anyone looking to buy a home. 
Thank you Warren for your dedication on finding us a great home!

I was moving to London from Timmins, ON and asked a friend, who lives here, who he would recommend; Warren was his answer. This man is a work horse and will keep at it until you find the house you want! I had to close a deal in less than a month and had very specific things I require in a house - needless to say - we made it happen.
I have recommended him to my HR person at the place I work and will definitely pass his name along!&nbsp;</span></i>&lt; </p>
